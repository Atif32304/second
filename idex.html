     ..<br> Also, the call to prayer of a woman and a child who does not understand is not correct;  Therefore, if either of the two gave the call to prayer, then it will be necessary to repeat it, but if the child is old enough to understand, then the call to prayer will be correct, but it is better that a mature and sensible person calls the call to prayer. Only God knows.</h2>
